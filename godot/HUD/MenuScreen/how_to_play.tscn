You can't place tiles freely, they must connect to another tile (available placements are highlighted)
A number between 1 and 3 is visible on each tile, it represents the score it will give you and also the weight of the tile
Beware, the board is not stable, if you put too much weight on one of the sides, it is game over
Once every starting tiles are joined, the second phase starts automatically 
Additionaly, some tiles have effects that resolve immediatly (like the reroll) or in the second phase (like monsters and chests)

In this mode, press R when you have a reroll charge to draw a new hand
You can use the arrow keys to move the camera, too"
